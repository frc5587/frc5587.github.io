            Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, all schools in Virginia have been closed for the rest of the academic
            year. Because of our concern for the health and safety of our community as well as the loss of our venue,
            we have canceled our May STEM expo and our summer camps in July and August. </b></u>.

            We are deeply saddened by the loss of our competition season as well as our equally valuable and enjoyable
            outreach opportunities. In spite of this, we will continue to serve our community by hosting a series of
            <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwYOGjxGOFGPVwwazCmtl_3I_Xeq33v8_" target="_blank">virtual outreach activities </a> designed to continue spreading STEM through our community.

            Even as we practice social distancing during these difficult times, we all are united in support of our
            community.

        </p>

        <p>
            Stay safe and healthy; we hope to see you soon once we get through this.
