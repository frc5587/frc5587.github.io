                hatch panels at all three levels of the rocket. During the sandstorm period, Guilloutina can be
                controlled through driver cameras and vision code to align onto field targets, allowing scoring on both
                the cargoship and rocket.</p>

                in the switch during the autonomous period, using motion profiling to complete either a left, center, or
                right autonomous run.</p>

            <p class="lead">Kernflake began in the 2017 offseason as our practice drive train, proving useful for
                gaining experience with the construction of a drive train. However, Kernflake ended up as the robot for
                the 2018 Power Up season after being fitted with witheld mechanisms after stop build day. Kernflake is
                now used in outreach events, where team members allow younger drivers to operate the robot due to its
                simplicity and stability.</p>

                gear and climb-oriented robot. This robot was able to score points in autonomous mode and retrieve
                fallen gears from the ground. The robot also used a winch to climb the side of an airship, scoring even
                more points in the end-game.</p>

                Christopher could stack and move totes, lift trash cans, and deposit "litter" into trash cans stacked
