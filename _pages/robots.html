                was capable of
                placing cubes on the scale or switch, and pushing cubes into the exchange. The robot was also able to
                score points in the switch during the autonomous period, using motion profiling to complete either a
                left, center, or right autonomous run.

            <p class="lead">Kernflake began in the 2017 offseason as our practice drive train, proving useful for
                gaining experience with
                the construction of a drive train. However, Kernflake was used in the 2018 Power Up season as a robot
                for driver practice
                when fitted with witheld mechanisms after the stop build day. Kernflake is now used in outreach events,
                where team members
                allow younger drivers to operate the robot due to its simplicity and stability.

                in autonomous mode,
                and retrieve fallen gears from the ground. The robot also used a winch to climb the side of an airship,
                scoring even more points in the end-game.</p>

                    Rush</a> was named Christopher.
                As the first robot built by our team, Christopher demonstrated the skill and dedication of the newly
                formed team.
                The robot could stack and move totes, lift trash cans, and deposit "litter" into trash cans stacked
                upon totes.</p>
