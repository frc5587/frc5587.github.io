                Rapid React</a>, Anklebiter was designed to efficiently and accurately make shots to the Upper Hub during both
                autonomous and teleoperated modes using it's turreted shooter. Additionally, Anklebiter iterated through many climb designs, however ended with a design
                allowing for a consistent traversal climb in under 10 seconds. Anklebiter also had quality autonomous routines,
                most notably it's 5-ball auto.</p>

                Bunnybots</a>, Rainmaker was designed to intake and move crates
                from the center of the field to 4 different corners. Additionally, Rainmaker had the ability to "dump" a (stuffed)
                bunny into one of the corners to score additional points. During the autonomous period, Rainmaker could pick up a crate
                and score. Rainmaker also now serves as our outreach robot.</p>

                built on the same powerful chassis as El Salmandor. Bob featured a lightning-quick hooded shooter and vectored intake design, feeding into a multi-stage 
                high powered conveyor system. In addition, it contained the most advanced path following software we have ever attempted, which was able to autonomously detect 
                the yellow "power cells" on the floor and move to collect them. Bob also featured very advanced limelight targeting to accurately score in the inner goal.

                the Limelight, an advanced vision system. It was capable of scoring in the inner goal and completing a climb at the end of a match.</p>

                and store multiple 4" wiffle balls, and fire them through its quick shooter. The shooter was also designed to shoot our "bunny" for

                Bunnybots</a>, Tractor was designed to carefully pick up racquetballs and precisely deposit them into a milkcrate from its large hopper. 
                Using clever plastic thermoforming techniques, we were able to construct the entire hopper from a single piece of polycarbonate plastic. 
                It also contained a small pincer to accurately position the "bunny" inside of the milk crates. In addition, 
                this robot represented our first experience with creating a vertical electrical board, designed to have a very compact form factor.
