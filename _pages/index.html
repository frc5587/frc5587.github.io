                Titan Robotics builds robots each year to compete in the FIRST Robotics Competition. In addition, we
                promote STEM awareness in our school and community by conducting outreach events and supporting robotics
                teams for younger children.

            <h1>Our Impact</h1>
            <p>
                Through participation in this team, high school students gain real-world experience in many fields of
                interest: not only can they learn engineering and technical skills, but also critical nontechnical
                skills which can be directly applied to whatever future career they pursue.
