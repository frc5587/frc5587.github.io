        <p class="content">Titan Robotics' annual Summer Camps returned this year with camps for all students grades Kindergarten through 8th grade. Our camp offerings this year included Physics FUNdamentals and Intro to Engineering and Robotics for K-2, LEGO Mindstorms and Rocketry for 3-5, and Java Programming, Mechanical Masters, and Health Sciences for 6-8. We were ecstatic to announce that, through a parnership through <a href="https://www.aim-ahead.net/">AIM-AHEAD</a>, our middle school camps were completely free! This allowed us to provide an opportunity to dozens of students completely free of charge, an opportunity which can often cost upwards of $500 in tuition fees alone.</p>

Most of the attendees were adult professionals, so we didn’t advertise our STEM programs, but rather introduced them to the world of FIRST Robotics. The event was also an educational experience for team members, as we got an opportunity to learn about hydrogen fuel cell technology from the very specialists who are spearheading it. </p>

There, we walked them through the basics of block coding. This lesson included the fundamental ideas of coding, primarily the need to break each command down into its subsequent actions. Using our favorite “Jelly Sandwich Activity”, we taught students how to think like a programmer. And then, for fun, students got to control our robot to execute their code!</p>

          Physics. We plan to expand with even more exciting options next summer! Campers enjoyed learning about STEM
          through hands-on activities and curricula developed and taught entirely by Titan Robotics student members.
          Thanks to our generous sponsors, we have even been able to provide need-based scholarships, enabling our
          summer programs to be accessible to all interested students.
