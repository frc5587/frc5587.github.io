            This year, we are excited to participate in Spring2ACTion! Spring2ACTion is a community fundraising event
            dedicated towards non-profits in Alexandria. We are committing 100% of our profits towards revitalizing our
            K-8 STEM programs within our city - we hope to give younger students opportunities to try robotics! Being
            the only student run and led organization participating in Spring2ACTion, we rely on generous people like
            you to spread the word and support our programs. Please help us continue to educate and inspire students to
            pursue STEM by donating <a href="https://www.spring2action.org/organizations/titan-robotics"
                target="_blank">here</a>. Learn more about what we’ve done in the past year below!

            This past year, we started creating videos exploring STEM-related projects, intro to engineering activities,
            and even fun parody videos. We hoped that by doing this, we would continue to have an impact on our
            community, even though we couldn’t mentor and teach in person.

            This season, we put in a lot of hard work to make our robot, Bob the Buildmo! Named after our host for this
            season, Building Momentum, Bob the Builmo was built from recycled parts of our previous robots, and was a
            fantastic robot Despite the many challenges we faced, we were still able to have an amazing season. In the
            end, we submitted a collection of our autonomous robot driving paths, and we are very proud of the work we
            were able to accomplish!
